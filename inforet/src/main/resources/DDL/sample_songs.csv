Lana Del Rey,Pride,"You have this way of making me say the opposite of everything I mean  
I kiss you, I hug you, but I could not feel less connected from you!  
I know I want it all this, in the beginning I really tried  
I know I could... not so happy time of your life.  
My dreams are bigger than all your junky pride  
I don't quit fit the part of... everything and falls into insanity.  
The sun beams, mean nothing if you can't find the light shining in one thing  
I know I want it all this, in the beginning I really tried  
I know I got you, and I'm not so happy... time of your life  
My dreams are bigger than your junky pride.  
It's fine if you're hateful, as long as you remain grateful  
It made me nervous... like me I really tried  
The way I'm feeling in this moment it can't last my whole life!  
My dreams are bigger than your junky pride! aa

Lana Del Rey,Riverside,"I seen you walk along the riverside  
I seen you walk along at ease  
And in the air I feel a silence  
It whispers perfect on the breeze  
And there's a voice that keeps me company  
It takes me closer to the stream  
And in the break of any suffering  
It makes me feel like there's no pain  
Finally, finally, finally I'm getting closer  
To the dream.  
To my dream I believe  
I'm up a creek and you're my paddle  
Where there is you there is my soul  
Another dream where I'm the witness  
I am the witness to your goal  
Finally, finally, finally I'm getting closer  
To the dream.  
To my dream I believe.

Lana Del Rey,Sad Girl,"Every single night when I go down to the west coast  
The people seem dead like I'm dancing with their ghost  
Nothing in this world keeps me more on my feet  
Than your sweet lovin' oooh your lovin'  
  
What happened to days when you were mine  
The way you looked, so God damned fine  
Guess I'll be alone this summertime  
  
'Cause I'm a sad girl dancing on my own  
Long way, far away from home  
Some day I will find you in the sunset  
I'm a sad girl, searching for a dream  
Just know that we're on each other's team  
Some day I will find you, you bet  
But now you've left me,  
Singing this sweet song  
Hold me, never held me for too long  
Love me, your love was porous like a rock  
Maybe you just forgot  
That I loved you

Lana Del Rey,Shades Of Cool,"My baby lives in shades of blue  
Blue eyes and jazz and attitude  
He lives in California too  
He drives a chevy Malibu  
  
And when he calls  
He calls for me and not for you  
He lives for love, he loves his drugs  
He loves his baby too  
  
But I can't fix him, can't make him better  
And I can't do nothing about his strange weather  
  
'Cause you are invincible  
I can't break through your world  
'Cause you live in shades of cool  
Your heart is unbreakable  
  
My baby lives in shades of cool  
Blue heart and hands and aptitude  
He lives for love, for women, too  
I'm one of many, one is blue  
  
And when he calls  
He calls for me and not for you  
He prays for love, he prays for peace  
And maybe someone new  
  
But I can't help him, can't make him better  
And I can't do nothing about his strange weather  
  
'Cause you are invincible  
I can't break through your world  
'Cause you live in shades of cool  
Your heart is unbreakable  
  
'Cause you are invincible

In your pearls  
Thinking that you're number

The last frontier  
They said you can make it anywhere  
If you can make it here  
But where no magic in the air  
  
What happened to Brooklyn?  
What happened to our scene baby?  
Have we all gone Gaga crazy?  
Remember when the streets used  
To be dangerous and we were born bad  
And we were born bad?  
  
Punk rock punk rock  
The boys used to punch each other in the face  
And girls were walking round wasted  
Everyone had a good night  
Came back when sunlight

Lana Del Rey,This Is What Makes Us Girls,"Remember how we used to party up all night  
Sneaking out and looking for a taste of real life  
Drinking in the small town firelight  
(Pabst Blue Ribbon on ice)  
  
Sweet sixteen and we had arrived  
Walking down the street as they whistle, ""Hi, hi!""  
Stealin' police cars with the senior guys  
Teachers said we'd never make it out alive  
  
There she was my new best friend  
High heels in her hands, swayin' in the wind  
While she starts to cry, mascara runnin' down her little Bambi eyes:  
""Lana, how I hate those guys.""  
  
This is what makes us girls  
We don't look for heaven and we put our love first  
Don't you know we'd die for it? It's a curse  
Don't cry about it, don't cry about it  
This is what makes us girls  
We don't stick together 'cause we put our love first  
Don't cry about him, don't cry about him  
It's all gonna happen  
  
And that's where the beginning of the end begun  
Everybody knew that we had too much fun  
We were skippin' school and drinkin' on the job  
(With the boss)  
  
Sweet sixteen and we had arrived  
Baby's table dancin' at the local dive  
Cheerin our names in the pink spotlight  
Drinkin' cherry schnapps in the velvet night  
  
Know we used to go break in  
to the hotel pool, glittering we'd swim  
Runnin' from the cops in our black bikini tops  
screaming, ""Get us while we're hot""  
""We don't give a whaaat!""  
  
This is what makes us girls  
We don't look for heaven and we put our love first  
Don't you know we'd die for it? It's a curse  
Don't cry about it, don't cry about it  
This is what makes us girls  
We don't stick together 'cause we put our love first  
Don't cry about him, don't cry about him  
It's all gonna happen  
  
The prettiest crowd that you had ever seen  
Ribbons in our hair and our eyes gleamed mean  
A freshmen generation of degenerate beauty queens  
And you know something?  
  
They were the only friends I ever had  
We got into trouble and when stuff got bad  
I got sent away, I was waving on the train platform  
Crying 'cause I know I'm never comin' back.  
  
This is what makes us girls  
We don't look for heaven and we put our love first  
Don't you know we'd die for it? It's a curse  
Don't cry about it, don't cry about it  
This is what makes us girls  
Darlin' little queens do you know what you're worth?  
I'll tell you everyday till you get it, girl  
It's all gonna happen  
  
This is what makes us girls now, baby.  
This is why we rule the world now, baby.  
This is what makes us girls now, baby.  
Why we rule the world now, baby, oh.  
  
This is what makes us girls now, baby.  
This is why we rule the world now, baby.

Living for the fame  
  
Kissing in the blue dark

He holds me in his big arms  
Drunk and I am seeing stars  
This is all I think of  
  
Watching all our friends fall  
In and out of Old Paul's  
This is my idea of fun  
Playing video games

Lana Del Rey,You're Gonna Love Me,"Jerry says that in the dark,  
I think I have a good idea.  
That I should do the opposite,  
  
Of whatever it is I feel  
That's because I have a bad mind  
And I have gold in my veins  
But he said I got the purest heart  
That he's ever seen  
  
What God gave me a brain for  
If he won't let me use it?  
What God give me a plan for  
If He won't help me do it?  
You're gonna love me  
I'm gonna make you  
You're gonna love me  
I'm gonna make you  
  
I can tell that you're the type  
To never trust a beauty queen  
But I was never voted for nothing and,  
Highschool never meant anything to anybody  
Never ever gave myself away  
But even when I'm funny  
You think I'm acting so I say  
  
What God give me a break for  
If he won't let me use it?  
What God give me a plan for?  
He never helps me do it  
You're gonna love me  
I'm gonna make you  
You're gonna love me  
I'm gonna make you  
  
You say that you don't want to be hypnotized  
But baby, I, I don't wanna hypnotize you  
There's nothing from you that I wanna take  
I just wanna be like you  
Maybe love you just a little bit  
Please  
  
Tell 'em mom and daddy gave themselves,  
I won't to you  
You told me to get my ways as I do what I'm gonna do  
I'm gonna strike out, right now  
I'm striking out right now with this song  
But I can't help myself  
I can't do right for long  
  
What God give me a break for  
If he won't let me use it?  
What God give me a Wlan for?  
He never helps me do it  
You're gonna love me  
I'm gonna make you  
You're gonna love me  
I'm gonna make you

Dil mein phir huuk utthi dil ka phir khoon hua - 2  
Dil ne phir yaad kiya bewafa laut bhi aa  
Bewafa laut bhi aa

Lata Mangeshkar,Gam Ki Vaadi,"Gam ki vaadi mein kushi ka karavaan khone laga  
  
Ishq mein jo kuch na hona thaa, vahi hone laga  
Gam ki vaadi mein kushi ka karavaan khone laga  
  
Kaun samajhega muhabbat ki bhala majabooriyaan  
Do dilon ki chaahaten duniya ki naa-manzooriyaan  
Muskuraane hi se pahale pyaar kyon rone laga  
Ishq mein jo kuch na hona thaa, vahi hone laga  
  
Saamane aankhon ke mere ishq ka anjaam hai  
Hai agar ye zindagi to maut kis ka naam hai  
Ranj-o-gam jaage, naseeba pyaar ka sone laga  
Ishq mein jo kuch na hona thaa, vahi hone laga
